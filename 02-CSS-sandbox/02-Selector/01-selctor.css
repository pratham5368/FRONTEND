/*We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)*/

/*The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.*/

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }


/*The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
*/

#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

  

/*The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.*/

.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
 /*to specify special selctor in an element*/  
 p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

/*The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.*/
* {
    text-align: center;
    color: blue;
  }


/*To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.*/
h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
