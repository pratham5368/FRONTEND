/*The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static
relative:-An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
fixed:-An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
absolute:-An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
sticky:-An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.*/
