/*In TypeScript, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of class properties and methods. There are three access modifiers in TypeScript:

public: This is the default access modifier. Properties and methods declared as public can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
private: Properties and methods declared as private can only be accessed within the same class. They are not accessible from outside the class.
protected: Properties and methods declared as protected can be accessed within the class and its subclasses. They are not accessible from outside the class and its subclasses.*/
